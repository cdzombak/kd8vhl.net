These are all the notes I have on programming and using [Uniden's BC75XLT](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1VSO9M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00A1VSO9M&linkCode=as2&tag=cdzombak-20). It's very simple overall.

Using the scanner is very straightforward. I found the manual that came with the scanner more than adequate for learning everything I need to use the scanner daily.

The manual also covers programming the scanner without a computer, which is tedious but possible for [smaller configurations]().

I used a Windows machine to program the scanner; there is seemingly no OS X software that can do it. It has a bad UI, but it works well enough, and it's easy to figure out.

The software and drivers are available [here: programmer and requisite drivers for the BC75XLT](http://info.uniden.com/UnidenMan4/BC75XLT). Windows Update wasn't able to locate and install drivers automatically; I had to manually install the driver from that page.

I installed the drivers and software from that page *before* plugging the scanner into the computer. The scanner should be turned on when you connect it to the computer.

Then, you'll need to tell the software which COM port to use (the drivers installed as COM3 for me). The auto-detect feature didn't seem to work. You can then start from scratch or download the configuration from your scanner.
